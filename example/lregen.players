# this players list is used to filter records for players
# accessing altsdb with "limited" policy

# reason to remove aliases - throw away game masters and conflicting players
# plus some information noise so players can't freely guess on chars
# excluded from acces to be desired suspected alts

# limited policy users can't access full db, can't write into it
# and can't see own records for obvious reasons :)

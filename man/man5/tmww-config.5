\fBtmww \fP- config format documentation
.PP
.SH FORMAT
Config consists of comments, options and sections. Comments start with #.
.PP
Options synthax:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    OPTIONNAME _whitespace_ unquoted_value
    OPTIONNAME _whitespace_ "double-quoted value"
.fam T
.fi
.PP
where OPTIONNAME is alphanumeric/underscore, unquoted value is single word,
quoted values have no restriction. Unquoted options are evaluated as is (e.g.
to expand path) so safety advice are same as to shell variables. Options are
available inside script with TMWW_ prefix, e.g. LINK become TMWW_LINK.
.PP
Sections synthax:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    SECTIONNAME _whitespace_ {
        [sectionline]\.\.\.
    }
.fam T
.fi
.PP
Sections are not parsed automatically. Example of section parsed in tmww script
is "event" section defining ring tone for event.
.PP
Sections may refer to lists, which are stored in $LISTPATH/$servername.
.PP
NOTE: lists purpose might be different from storing char names, so it's
recommended for lists to skip unknown mappings ("key: value")
.PP
Configs allows INCLUDE special option to include other config. Only one config
can be included, no recursive inclusions.
.PP
Some path variables should be quoted (they are expanded inside plugin). Consult
respective plugin manuals.

.SH SECTIONS
.SS Section "actions"
.nf
.fam C
    _plugin/function_ [ arguments ]

.fi
.PP
Actions to perform in order they listed with repective options after action
name. Action which is not built-in tried as plugin.
.PP
built-in actions:
.TP
.B
fetch
download and process online list (see notes on dryrun in this document)
.TP
.B
localfetch
copy local tmwa online list and process it
.TP
.B
servertime
print servertime
.TP
.B
summary
print number of players online
.TP
.B
loggedon
print players logged on
.TP
.B
loggedoff
print players logged off
.TP
.B
newline
print newline
.TP
.B
ring
use default ring
.TP
.B
external
special word forging action command line and passing it to external executable
.TP
.B
event
same as external but only when logon/logoff detected
.TP
.B
script
execute script embedded inside section
.PP
\fIring\fP calls \fIPLAY\fP command with argument from \fIevent\fP section on matched event.
.PP
\fIexternal\fP command passes arguments to external application.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    external echo tmp: $TMWW_TMP
    external echo 123 | awk -- "{print \"a $servername b\",\$0,\"c\"}"
    external printf "some variable %s here\n" $TMWW_LINK
    external sleep 2
    event printf "\a"
.fam T
.fi
.PP
\fIscript\fP executes shell code from defined section. All internal facilities
available. See man section "Script".
.SS Section "event"
.nf
.fam C
    all { on | off } _sound_
    _list_ { on | off } _sound_
    pattern _regexp_ { on | off } _sound_
.fam T
.fi
.PP
Rules for RING action. Only last matched event will be played.
.PP
Pattern match char names. Lists are taken from LISTPATH and are simple charname
per line (comments allowed).
.PP
This section is empty by default.
.SS Section "overload"
.nf
.fam C
    lib substituted_libs+
.fam T
.fi
.PP
This section is empty by default and used to overload libraries providing
functions with colliding names.
.PP
.SH SCRIPT ACTION
\fIscript\fP executes shell code from defined section. All internal facilities
available. See man section "Script".
.PP
Parameters are taken from actions list. To restore parameters from command
line, do:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    eval set -- "$prefixed_params"
.fam T
.fi
.PP
Section should be finished just as any other section with line containing only
"}". Return from "script" action is done with "continue" statement.
.PP
NOTE: there are some troubles e.g. with escaping double quotes inside double
quotes caused by executing from shell eval function, they are easily
bypassed with single quotes or double/single quotes alteration.
.PP
See \fBtmww-plugin\fP(7) for description of tmww provided facilities.
.PP
.SH NOTES
.SS Multiple users setup
Script won't do your administrative tasks, so it's necessary that shared
folders (like TMP) are manually created with chgrp and chmod 2770 (ug+rw and
g+s); user umask should be 002 (if no other methods, should be added in
~/.profile), or better of all ACL set with
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    setfacl -d -m group:yourgroup:rw shared/
.fam T
.fi
.PP
There are two options to check:
.IP 1) 4
directory with group write access so group members can remove files
.IP 2) 4
files are g+w which most probably require setting up ACL
.PP
Operations on shared files require both things but online lists sharing
("fetch" action) will work even without ACL set just with files removed before
write attempt.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    PLUGINPATH /shared/folder/plugins
    UTILPATH /shared/folder/utils
    LOCK /shared/folder/.tmp/lock
    TMP /shared/folder/.tmp

.SH DESCRIPTION
Use cases:
.TP
.B
-
determining time when client was updated to compare to other suspected
alts. Workflow includes calling \fItimeline\fP on given interval with \fB-p\fP
option to include results for all known associated alts and then comparing
them to suspected char by \fB-c\fP option (or \fB-C\fP/-a).
.TP
.B
-
compare clients on given time interval by summary statistics. Workflow
include call of \fIsimilar\fP subcommand (optionally with \fB-i\fP key to include
target player chars into top rate) and then \fIsummary\fP for chars from
result.
.PP
NOTE: \fIpattern\fP search can be used to match charname since both charname and
useragent are on same line

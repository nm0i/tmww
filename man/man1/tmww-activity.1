.PP
All functions has kind of limits, e.g. default max days diapason is 150 and max
month diapason is 60. Logon/logoff event maximum count of players also has
default limit of 150.
.PP
Lastseen function has 2 working modes. 1st mode choosed with 1 line output
(default, set with \fB-n\fP option) and no provided dates interval. It will search
over all present logs starting from end. Other mode outputting more than 1
record require diapason set in days.
.PP
Average output bars are relative to each other. Daily and monthly bars are
absolute with 86400 seconds for monthly bar (full day) and 3600 seconds for
daily (full hour).
.PP
Bars can visually merge in two nearby lines. This could be solved choosing in
config lower ticks number.
.PP
Bars legend: "-" mean no data, "." mean zero appearance. Default timeout to get
"no data" is 20 minutes - if no events of logon/logoff happened (usually means
record was stopped or server downtime).
